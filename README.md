<h1>User Story</h1>

<h2>AS AN employer</h2>

<p>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

<p>
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:
</p>

<h2>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>WHEN I load their portfolio</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</li>
<li>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation</li>
<li>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work</li>
<li>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</li>
<li>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application</li>
<li>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the images of the applications</li>
<li>THEN I am taken to that deployed application</li>
<li>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</li>
</ul>
